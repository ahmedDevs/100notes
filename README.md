Project Name: 100notes

This is a group CRUD app project utilizing Node.js/Express to build our own API. The user will be able to create/delete/edit their own notes and all notes will be stored in a database via MongoDB. Users will also be able to notes sort by date/importance.

How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.JS, Express, MongoDB

We started out building our API via Node.js and Express, making sure all create, update and delete functionality was working
Once we had the main functionality working we began working with CSS to establish a general layout of where the notes would be and how they would be stored on screen for the user. 

<!-- Lessons Learned: No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
